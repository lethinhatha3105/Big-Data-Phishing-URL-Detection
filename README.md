### Big Data Phishing URLs Detection with Apache Spark

#### Objective

This project is an example of handling basic machine learning problem with large datasets, using Apache Spark.

Its main objective is not data analysis or models' accuracy but understanding **the optimization and performance tuning** of Apache Spark. 

#### Dataset

The dataset studied is [**Tabular dataset ready for malicious url detection**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pilarpieiro/tabular-dataset-ready-for-malicious-url-detection), consisting of two files: a training set (2GB) and a testing set (489MB).

Although these files do yet qualify as *"big data"*, they provide a solid starting point for becoming familiar with Apache Spark.

#### System's status

The parameters in the code were adjusted to run on the following system configuration: 

**Available memory** : 26 GB 
- *free* : 21GB
- *buff/cache* : 5GB
